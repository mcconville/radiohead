Airbag

[Verse 1]
In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Verse 2]
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe


Paranoid Android

[Verse 1]
Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)

[Verse 2]
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)

[Bridge 1]
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does

[Bridge 2]
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on, rain down)
The yuppies networking (On me)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah


Lucky

[Verse 1]
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

[Chorus]
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

[Verse 2]
The head of state
Has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

[Chorus]
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

[Outro]
We are standing on the edge


Subterranean Homesick Alien

[Verse 1]
The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

[Chorus]
They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

[Verse 2]
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away but I'd be alright, alright
Mom, I'm alright, alright

[Chorus]
I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight


Fitter Happier

[Spoken Verse]
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable (Not drinking too much)
Regular exercise at the gym (Three days a week)
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well (No more microwave dinners and saturated fats)
A patient, better driver
A safer car (Baby smiling in back seat)
Sleeping well (No bad dreams)
No paranoia
Careful to all animals (Never washing spiders down the plughole)
Keep in contact with old friends (Enjoy a drink now and then)
Will frequently check credit at (Moral) bank (hole in wall)
Favours for favours
Fond but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
(No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants)
Car wash (Also on Sundays)
No longer afraid of the dark
Or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned (But powerless)
An empowered and informed member of society (Pragmatism not idealism)
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet (Shot of baby strapped in back seat)
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit (The ability to laugh at weakness)
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics


The Tourist

[Verse 1]
It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin
No one else would know

[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second

[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down


Electioneering

[Verse 1]
I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

[Laughing]

[Verse 2]
Riot shields, voodoo economics, your turn, your turn
It's just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F
I trust I can rely on your vote

[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet


No Surprises

[Verse 1]
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

[Chorus]
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

[Verse 2]
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

[Verse 3]
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Get me out of here)


Let Down

[Verse 1]
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Verse 2]
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

[Pre-Chorus]
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Bridge]
Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

[Verse 3]
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day
I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and useless
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and
(You know where you are)

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around


Karma Police

[Verse 1]
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

[Verse 2]
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

[Verse 3]
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself


Climbing Up the Walls

[Verse 1]
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends 'til we die

[Chorus]
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

[Verse 2]
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

[Chorus]
That either way he turns
I will be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
