Just

[Verse 1]
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

[Verse 2]
Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door

[Pre-Chorus 2]
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self


Black Star

[Verse 1]
I get home from work
And you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well, what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?

[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

[Verse 2]
The troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake, but it's 58 hours
Since that I last slept with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore

[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

[Verse 3]
I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
When I see a face like you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down

[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

[Outro]
Ah, this is killing me
Ah, this is killing me


Planet Telex

[Verse 1]
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

[Verse 2]
You can force it but it will stay stone
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

[Outro]
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?


Bones

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees, and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

[Chorus]
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

[Verse 2]
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers

[Chorus]
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

[Bridge]
And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

[Outro]
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones


Sulk

[Verse 1]
You bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk
You sit there and bawl
You look so pretty
When you're on your knees
Disinfected
And eager to please

[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

[Verse 2]
Each time it comes
It eats me alive
I try to behave
But it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change


Bullet Proof..I Wish I Was

[Verse 1]
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Stirring up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I
Was bulletproof

[Verse 2]
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it

[Chorus]
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof

[Verse 3]
So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead, fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate

[Chorus]
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof


(Nice Dream)

[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here


The Bends

[Verse 1]
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken

[Verse 2]
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

[Chorus]
My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

[Refrain]
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

[Verse 3]
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away
To blow me sky high

[Chorus]
My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

[Refrain]
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

[Bridge]
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
Race, race, race

[Outro]
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?


My Iron Lung

[Verse 1]
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

[Verse 2]
We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung

[Chorus]
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

[Verse 3]
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, we'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung

[Chorus]
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

[Bridge]
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay

[Chorus]
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon


High and Dry

[Verse 1]
Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Verse 2]
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

[Chorus]
So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry


Fake Plastic Trees

[Verse 1]
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

[Chorus 1]
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

[Verse 2]
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

[Chorus 2]
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

[Verse 3]
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

[Chorus 3]
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

[Outro]
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
