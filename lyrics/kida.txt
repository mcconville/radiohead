Morning Bell

[Verse 1]
Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round

[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

[Outro]
The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a friend
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking


In Limbo

[Intro]
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can’t read
Another message I can’t read

[Verse 1]
I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down

[Chorus]
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world

[Verse 2]
I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

[Chorus]
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
The most beautiful woman in the world

[Outro]
Come back
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back


How to Disappear Completely

[Verse 1]
That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

[Verse 2]
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

[Chorus]
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

[Bridge]
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes

[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here


Optimistic

[Verse 1]
Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Verse 2]
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Bridge]
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Float around on a prison ship

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth


Motion Picture Soundtrack

[Verse 1]
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Verse 2]
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Outro]
I will see you in the next life


Everything in Its Right Place

[Intro]
(Kid A, Kid A)
(Kid A, Kid A)

[Chorus]
Everything

Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

[Chorus]
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place

[Verse 2]
There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say, tried to say
Tried to say, tried to say

[Outro]
Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything


Idioteque

[Verse 1]
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first
And the children first, and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow until I burst
Until I burst, until I
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much
I haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first, and children

[Chorus]
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time

[Verse 2]
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Throw it in the fire
Throw it in the fire, throw it on the
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping
Take the money and run
Take our money and run, take our money

[Chorus]
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time

The National Anthem

[Verse 1]
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on

[Verse 2]
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

[Chorus]
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on

[Outro]
Smile


Kid A

[Verse 1]
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

[Verse 2]
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists

[Verse 3]
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

[Outro]
The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids
