Morning Bell/Amnesiac

[Verse 1]
The morning bell, the morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me, yeah
Release me
Release me

[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Your clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
And I might as well, I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around
And round

[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

[Outro]
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me


I Might Be Wrong

[Verse 1]
I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think, I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Open up, begin again

[Chorus 1]
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

[Verse 2]
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Open up and let me in

[Chorus 2]
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all, nothing at all

[Outro]
Keep it moving
Keep it moving


Like Spinning Plates

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance

[Verse 2]
When this just feels like
Spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
And this just feels like
Spinning plates
My body's floating down the muddy river


Dollars & Cents

[Verse 1]
There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear a weapon we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you're talking war games

[Chorus]
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)

[Verse 2]
You don't live in a business world and
You never go out and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
All over, baby's crying
It'll all over, maybe, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

[Chorus]
(Quiet down)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents


Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors

[Verse 1]
There are barn doors and there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships and there are revolving doors

[Verse 2]
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors and there are secret doors

[Verse 3]
There are doors that lock and doors that don't
There are doors that let you in and out but never open
And there are trapdoors that you can't come back from


You and Whose Army?

[Verse 1]
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy?
Well, come on, come on

[Refrain]
You and whose army?
You and your cronies

[Verse 2]
Come on, come on
Holy Roman Empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on

[Refrain]
You and whose army?
You and your cronies

[Verse 3]
You forget so easy
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses


Life in a Glasshouse

[Verse 1]
Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glasshouse

[Verse 2]
And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

[Verse 3]
Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glasshouse

[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only only...
There's someone listening in


Hunting Bears

[Instrumental]


Knives Out

[Verse 1]
I want you to know he's not coming back
Look into my eyes, I'm not coming back

[Chorus 1]
So knives out, catch the mouse
Don't look down, shove it in your mouth

[Verse 2]
If you'd been a dog, they would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

[Chorus 2]
So knives out, cook him up
Squash his head, put him in the pot

[Verse 3]
I want you to know he's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

[Chorus 3]
So knives out, catch the mouse
Squash his head, put him in the pot


Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box

[Verse 1]
After years of waiting nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes, you realize

[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case

[Verse 2]
After years of waiting
After years of waiting nothing came
And you realize you're looking in, looking in the wrong place

[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case

[Bridge]
After years of waiting

[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case


Pyramid Song

[Verse]
I jumped in the river and what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

[Verse]
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
