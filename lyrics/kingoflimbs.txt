Bloom

[Verse 1]
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with whys

[Verse 2]
I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(As jellyfish float by)
Jellyfish float by

[Outro]
It's what keeps me alive


Morning Mr Magpie

[Verse 1]
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it off, give it back
You stole it off, give it back

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory

[Verse 2]
You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

[Chorus]
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all my magic
Took my melody


Codex

[Verse 1]
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasized
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong

[Verse 2]
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent


Lotus Flower

[Verse 1]
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

[Chorus]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2]
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

[Bridge]
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Oh, the bird thatâ€™s flown into my room

[Chorus]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart


Feral

[Verse]
You're not mine
I'm not yours
It's all fine
Please don't judge, judge
(You're not mine)

[Repeated Infinitum]
Judge


Separator

[Chorus]
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
It's like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream

[Verse 1]
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart
In my mouth

[Chorus]
Like I've fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

[Verse 2]
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carrying me
(Did so much, did so much)

[Verse 3]
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under

[Bridge]
And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong  (Wake me up)
If you think this is over (Wake me up)
Then you're wrong (Wake me up)

[Chorus]
Like I've fallen out of bed (Wake me up)
From a long and vivid dream (Wake me up)
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying (Wake me up, wake me up)

[Outro]
When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?


Little by Little

[Verse 1]
Don't turn nasty now
The dusts of hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

[Chorus 1]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been 'round you've been around enough
Ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Ooh

[Verse 2]
The glue won't hold
The thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

[Bridge]
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
The drug that will kill you
Kill you
Oh, you

[Chorus 2]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt


Give Up the Ghost

[Intro]
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

[Verse 1]
Gather up the lost and their souls (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)

[Verse 2]
(Into your arms)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost
(Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me)

[Outro]
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
Into your arms (Don't hurt me)
