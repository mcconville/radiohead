Anyone Can Play Guitar

[Verse 1]
Destiny, destiny, protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

[Chorus]
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore

[Verse 2]
Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

[Chorus]
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore


Blow Out

[Verse 1]
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

[Chorus]
And everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
And everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone

[Verse 2]
I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out

[Chorus]
And everything I touch
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up and sugar-coated)
Turns to stone

[Instrumental]


How Do You?

[Verse 1]
He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and
He wants to belong
He wants us to listen
He wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

[Chorus]
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 2]
He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot
But we always forget
And he's just like his daddy
'Cause he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

[Chorus]
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?


Thinking About You

[Verse 1]
Been thinking about you
Your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall
Your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one
And you're my star
What do you care?

[Verse 2]
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care when the other men are far, far better?

[Chorus]
All the things you've got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?

[Verse 3]
I've been thinking about you
So how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends
They're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
And why should you care, when I'm not there?

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care, when I'm not there?

[Chorus]
All the things you've got
That you'll never need
All the things you've got
I've bled and I bleed to please you

[Outro]
Been thinking about you


Lurgee

[Verse 1]
I feel better
I feel better now you've gone
I got better
I got better, I got strong
I feel better
I feel better now there's nothing wrong
I got better
I got better, I got strong

[Verse 2]
Tell me something
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me one thing
Tell me one thing and let it go
I got something
I got something, heaven knows
I got something
I got something I don't know


You

[Verse 1]
You are the sun and moon and stars are you
And I could never run away from you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?

[Verse 3]
It's like the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?
Myâ€“

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You, me and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see me drowning
Caught in the fire
You, me and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see me drowning
Caught in the fire


Vegetable

[Verse 1]
I never wanted anything but this
I worked hard, tried hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died long

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time you're running out of here
Every time you're running I get the fear

[Verse 2]
I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Every time you're running out on me
Every time you're running I can see

[Chorus]
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

[Bridge]
The waters spray, the waters run all over me
The waters spray, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay

[Chorus]
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself


Stop Whispering

[Verse 1]
And the wise man said I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man said I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

[Chorus]
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

[Verse 2]
And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
'Cause I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

[Chorus]
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

[Bridge]
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is
It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway

[Outro]
Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop whispering, stop whispering
Stop, stop


Prove Yourself

[Verse 1]
I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

[Chorus]
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

[Verse 2]
I wanna breathe, I wanna grow
I'd say I want it but I don't know how
I work, I bleed, I beg and pray

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

[Chorus]
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

[Chorus]
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Why?
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself


I Can't

[Verse 1]
Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down

[Chorus]
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

[Verse 2]
So many things that keep, that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find

[Bridge]
If you give up on me now
I'll be gutted like I've never been before

[Chorus]
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

[Bridge]
If you give up on me now
I'll be gutted like I've never been before

[Chorus]
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't


Creep

[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here


Ripcord

[Verse 1]
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed

[Chorus]
You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
But you don't understand
You've no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord

[Verse 2]
Aeroplane, do I mean what I mean?
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane

[Chorus]
A thousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you don't understand
You've no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
With no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
