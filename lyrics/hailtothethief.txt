A Punch Up At A Wedding

[Intro]
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no

[Verse 1]
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight

[Chorus 1]
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round, you stay frozen to the spot

[Chorus 2]
The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

[Outro]
No no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no


Scatterbrain

[Verse 1]
I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill

[Verse 2]
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

[Bridge]
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain


Sail to the Moon

[Verse 1]
I sailed the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars

[Verse 2]
Maybe you'll be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood you'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon

[Outro]
Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon


There There

[Verse 1]
In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

[Verse 2]
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)

[Interlude]
There, there

[Bridge]
Why so green and lonely?
Lonely, lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen


I Will

[Verse]
I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes eyes


A Wolf at the Door

[Verse 1]
Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you"
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you, flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside

[Chorus]
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

[Bridge]
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 2]
Walking like giant cranes and
With my X-ray eyes, I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
Oh, I wish you'd get up
Get over, get up, get over, turn your tape off

[Chorus]
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna...


Sit Down. Stand Up

[Chorus]
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up

[Verse 1]
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down)
Walk into the jaws of hell (stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime (stand up)

[Chorus]
Sit down, stand up
Sit down

[Verse 2]
Hey, we can wipe you out anytime (stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down)
Anytime
Anytime

[Interlude]
Stand up
Sit down

[Bridge]
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops


Go to Sleep

[Verse 1]
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

[Verse 2]
Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

[Bridge]
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down

[Chorus]
May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me


Backdrifts

1."Creep" - Pablo Honey (1993)

Radiohead's first album, Pablo Honey, is a product of it's time. It was released when grunge music was just becoming mainstream. This album is grungy and messy, with some gems such as their hit single "Creep" and the acoustic ballad "Thinking About You" In my opinion this album is the weakest of all of their albums, but once you listen to all of their albums and become a fan,  you will appreciate this classic.

2."Just" - The Bends (1995)

This album marks Radiohead's first step away from their popular, gritty, rock sound. Despite the similarities to Pablo Honey, songs like "Just", "Planet Telex', and "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" represent the change Radiohead made to their song writing. Thom Yorke's lyrics are much darker than the previous album, and there are more layers of sounds per song than Pablo Honey.

3."Paranoid Android" - Ok Computer (1997)

The song Paranoid Android is truly representative of the album Ok Computer. The song is broken down into four parts, where each band member wrote on part too it. The album still holds on to some of the grit that both Pablo Honey, but adds elements of electronic music, such as the songs "Climbing Up the Walls" and "Subterranean Homesick Alien". This is the first conceptual album that Radiohead released expressing their anti-capitalist message ["Fitter Happier"] through the idea that technology controlling every aspect of our lives. This is also represented through the new elements of sound the band includes.

4."Everything in it's Right Place" - Kid A (2000)

The album Kid A marks a major turning point in Radiohead's sound. This album is void of the grunge rock feeling that the prior albums consisted of. It is considered an innovative electronic/alternative album and is considered by many to be the their best. Songs like, "The National Anthem" use a variety of electronic devices (such as a transistor radio) layered together in order to create one chaotic sound. It takes a couple of listens to get into the album, but once you are into it this will be a fan.

5."Packt Like Sardines in a Tin Can" - Amnesiac (2001)

Amnesiac is a weird album. It holds on to the electronic feel that Kid A had, but also incorporates some of their old sound. This can be seen in the song, "I Might Be Wrong". However, songs like "Pulk/Pull Revolving Door", and "Like Spinning Plates" shows the new sound that Radiohead was adapting.

6."Myxomatosis" - Hail to the Thief (2003)

The album Hail to the Thief is Radiohead's most political album. Each song consists a subtle messages criticizing the political backdrop of the time, such as "2+2=5" and "A Wolf at the Door". The sound of this album combines the electronic vibe of Amnesiac and Kid A, as well as the more bare-boned sound The Bends consists of. In my opinion this album is one of the most under-rated albums.

7."Reckoner" - In Rainbows (2007)

In my opinion In Rainbows is the closest thing to a masterpiece that Radiohead has put out. Every song is layered perfectly and flows from one to another like a beautiful stream of sonic mastery. Songs like, "Nude", "House of Cards", and "Jigsaws Falling into Place" show that Radiohead strayed from their previous albums in order to create their very own sound. Despite songs like "Bodysnatchers" that retain the grit from Ok Computer, this album is new and fresh and requires you to listen from start to finish in order to truly understand the In Rainbows experience.

8."The Daily Mail" - The King of Limbs (2011)

The King of Limbs marks the next step in Radiohead's career. After developing their sound into something completely their own, this album tries to push that even farther. Songs like "Bloom" and "Feral" sound familiar to songs on Kid A and Amnesiac. One of the most notable songs is "Give Up the Ghost". As Radiohead developed as artists, started to layer their tracks even more, combining multiple simple melodies to create a complex song. "Give Up the Ghost" uses layering in a different way from prior albums. The song is performed by Thom York (vocalist) only. He uses a looping track of his own voice to harmonize with himself. It leaves us Radiohead fans wondering what will be the next development in their sound? The last song on the album, "Separator" surely gives hint of what to look for next.

"If you think this is over then you're wrong" (Separator)


The Gloaming

[Verse 1]
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny, ha-ha, funny how
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

[Verse 2]
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the gloaming


We Suck Young Blood

[Verse 1]
Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

[Hook 1]
We want the young blood

[Verse 2]
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten, moth eaten?

[Hook 2]
We suck young blood
We suck young blood

[Verse 3]
Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

[Hook 3]
We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood


2 + 2 = 5

[Intro]
We're on, that's a nice way to start, Jonny

[Verse 1]
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

[Verse 2]
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five

[Bridge]
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because

[Chorus]
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention

[Verse 3]
I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not, 'cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies
But like flies, the bugs keep coming back
Not, but I'm not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But I'm not, but I'm not
But I'm not, but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in a box
'Cause I'm not, cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king
That the sky is falling in
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not
Maybe not, maybe not


Where I End and You Begin

[Verse 1]
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

[Bridge]
4, 5, 6, 7
(Get to heaven)

[Verse 2]
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

[Verse 3]
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

[Outro]
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive


Myxomatosis

[Verse 1]
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

[Verse 2]
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I
Feel so skinned alive

[Verse 3]
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
