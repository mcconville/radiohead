House of Cards

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts

[Chorus]
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
And fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial

[Verse 2]
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'good night'

[Chorus]
And forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial

[Outro]
(Your ears should be burning)
Denial, denial
(Your ears should be burning)
Denial, denial


Weird Fishes/Arpeggi

[Verse 1]
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

[Verse 2]
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way Out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way Out)
Is my chance

[Bridge]
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Yeah, I...
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I...
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape


Videotape

[Verse 1]
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape...

[Verse 2]
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day I've ever seen


Bodysnatchers

[Verse 1]
I do not understand
What it is I've done wrong
Full of holes, check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes, two for no

[Hook 1]
I've no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out

[Verse 2]
You killed the sound, removed backbone
A pale imitation with the edges all sawn off

[Hook 2]
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your arse

[Verse 3]
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the twenty-first century
It is the twenty-first century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm alive

[Outro]
I've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming


Nude

[Chorus]
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

[Verse 1]
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

[Verse 2]
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

[Chorus]
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking


Jigsaw Falling Into Place

[Verse 1]
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you had too much
Come back in focus again

The walls abandon shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
Jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once, not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got the light you can feel it on your back
A light you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place


All I Need

[Verse 1]
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore

[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

[Verse 2]
I'm a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others

[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

[Outro]
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's all right,  it's all right,  it's all right
It's all wrong,  it's all right
It's all right,  it's all right


15 Step

[Chorus]
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

[Verse 1]
You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

[Verse 2]
You used to be alright
What happened?
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever
Fifteen steps, then a sheer drop

[Chorus]
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the string


Faust Arp

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall
Like dominoes
In pretty patterns
Fingers in
The blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

[Hook 1]
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
For no real reason

[Verse 2]
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
And take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
An elephant that's in the room is
Tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate

[Hook 2]
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuck, stuck, stuck
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough, is enough?
I love you but enough is enough, enough of that stuff
There's no real reason

[Outro]
You've got a head full of feathers
You got melted to butter


Reckoner

[Verse 1]
Reckoner
Can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

[Verse 2]
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name

[Refrain]
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings

[Bridge]
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate (In rainbows)
Like ripples on a blank shore (In rainbows)

[Verse 3]
Reckoner
Take me with you

[Refrain]
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings
